## Setup

```bash
$ npm install
```


## Authentication

Make sure to provide a valid BitFinex API Key and Secret pair as environment variable with, e.g.

```
export API_KEY=<FinexApiKey>
export SECRET=<FinexApiSecret>
```

## Execute Tests

### Run Single Tests

Available Tests:

```
[
    rest-ticker, 
    rest-orders,
    rest-positions,
    socket-ticker,
    socket-trades,
    socket-auth-fail
    socket-get-orders
]
```

```
$ node <testName>.js
```

### Run All Tests 

```
$ npm start
```

## Reporting

Test failures will be thrown, otherwise a small report will appear, looking similar to this:

```                 
OK. Trades Array Length and Types valid.
```

## Integration Tests

In case it doesn't work on your machine.
